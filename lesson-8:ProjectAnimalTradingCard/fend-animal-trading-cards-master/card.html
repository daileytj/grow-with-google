			<p class="summary">Boa Constrictors are one of the largest snakes in the world, along with the Reticulated Python and Anaconda.  Boas are non-poisonous but just as deadly.  They ambush their prey, which means that they will hide and wait for something yummy to go by and then do a surprise attack. They use their flicking tongue to pick up the scent.  Just as their name suggests, they will coil their bodies around the prey and with each breath of the prey they will constrict, or squeeze, their coils just a little tighter until the animal can no longer breath.  Their prey consists of birds, lizards, frogs and small mammals. Larger Boas will even eat monkeys, pigs or deer.</p>
