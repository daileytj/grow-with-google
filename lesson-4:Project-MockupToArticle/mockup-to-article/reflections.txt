Your response goes here!

I learned about the deprecated state of the <strike> element, which has now been replaced by the <s> or <del> element depending on the use case.
Most of the course has been relatively easy so far.
The hardest part to this point was actually setting up the Udacity feedback Chrome extension.
Making use of the MDN docs have been extremely useful for solving problems and staying up to date with what elements to use (i.e. using the <s> element instead of the <strike> element).
